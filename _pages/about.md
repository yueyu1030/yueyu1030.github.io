Hello World! I am a 5th year PhD student at School of Computational Science and Engineering, [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://gatech.edu/). I mainly work on the intersection of Large Language Models and Data-centric AI.

Before joining Georgia Tech, I obtained my bachelor's degree (with honors) from the Department of Electronic Engineering, [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2019, where I have also worked on spatio-temporal data mining under the supervision of [Prof. Yong Li](http://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/~liyong/).

Feel free to drop me an email (`yueyu at gatech dot edu`) if you have any questions about my research, or general discussions about NLP.

**<span style="color:red">I am actively seeking industrial R&D opportunities, beginning after Summer 2024. I am happy to engage in discussions regarding potential opportunities!</span>**
